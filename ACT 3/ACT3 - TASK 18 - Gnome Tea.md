## HINTS: ##

  <summary>Hints provided for Task 13</summary>
  
>-	**GnomeTea:** I heard rumors that the new GnomeTea app is where all the Gnomes spill the tea on each other. It uses Firebase which means there is a client side config the app uses to connect to all the firebase services.
>-  **Statically Coded:** Hopefully they did not rely on hard-coded client-side controls to validate admin access once a user validly logs in. If so, it might be pretty easy to change some variable in the developer console to bypass these controls.
>-  **License:** Exif jpeg image data can often contain data like the latitude and longitude of where the picture was taken.
>-  **Rules:** Hopefully they setup their firestore and bucket security rules properly to prevent anyone from reading them easily with curl. There might be sensitive details leaked in messages.

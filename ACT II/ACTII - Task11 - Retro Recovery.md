>-	Wow! A disk from the 1980s! I remember delivering those computer disks to the good boys and girls. Games were their favorite, but they weren't like they are now.
>-  I miss old school games. I wonder if there is anything on this disk? I remember, when kids would accidentlly delete things.......... it wasn't to hard to recover files. I wonder if you can still mount these disks?
>-  I know there are still tools available that can help you find deleted files. Maybe that might help. Ya know, one of my favorite games was a Quick Basic game called Star Trek.

## PROCEDURE : ##

We start off this objective by speaking to Mark DeVito who is inside the Retro Emnporium.  He gives us a [floppy.img](../Assets/floppy.img) file and asks us to see whether we can recover any data from it.  He also hints that data might be hiding in the form of a deleted file that is still on the disk.

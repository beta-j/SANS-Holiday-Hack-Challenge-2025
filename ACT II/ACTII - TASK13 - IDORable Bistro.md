## HINTS: ##
<details>
  <summary>Hints provided for Task 13</summary>
  
>-	**QR Codes:** I have been seeing a lot of receipts lying around with some kind of QR code on them. I am pretty sure they are for Duke Dosis's Holiday Bistro. Interesting...see you if you can find one and see what they are all about...
>-  **Will the Real ID Please...:** Sometimes...developers put in a lot of effort to anonymyze information by using randomly generated identifiers...but...there are also times where the "real" ID is used in a separate Network request...
>-  **Who's For Lunch?:** I had tried to scan one of the QR codes and it took me to somebody's meal receipt! I am afraid somebody could look up anyone's meal if they have the correct ID...in the correct place.

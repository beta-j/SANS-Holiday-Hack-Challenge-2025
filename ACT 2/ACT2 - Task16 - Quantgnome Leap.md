  <summary>Hints provided for Task 16</summary>
  
>-	User keys are like presents. The keys are kept in a hidden location until they need to be used. Hidden files in Linux always start with a dot. Since everything in Linux is a file, directories that start with a dot are also...hidden!

>-  When you give a present, you often put a label on it to let someone know that the present is for them. Sometimes you even say who the present is from. The label is always put on the outside of the present so the public knows the present is for a specific person. SSH keys have something similar called a comment. SSH keys sometimes have a comment that can help determine who and where the key can be used.
